In these cases the item can be tagged simply by appending and prepending tags.\r\nThe more difficult case is when the start and end nodes are different. \r\nIn this case the selection has to be expanded in such a way as to maintain the well formed-ness of the DOM.\r\n\r\nThere are several way one could solve this problem.\r\nOne way would be to simply append the tag to the first common ancestor for the two points.\r\nA way which may be better would be to track the nodes up to their common ancestor and see \r\nif they are the same node. If they are not, then surround the nodes with a tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed functions\r\nAll functions are assumed to be run in the browser, with access to the global document and window objects.\r\n\r\n* Find correct scope\r\n\t```\r\n\t@param range: Range, the Range object containing the selected text\r\n\t@return Range, a range object containing the range which should be tagged\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n* Surround DocumentFragment with tags\r\n\r\n\t```\r\n\t@param range: Range, the range to be surrounded with tags\r\n\t@param string: tag, the name of the tag to be created(default: span) \r\n\t@param string: className, the name of the class the tag should be given(default: none)\r\n\t@return a Element object containing the tagged text\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n* Ancestor or self (to make sure we only tag the content) \r\n\r\n\t```\r\n\t@param descendant: Object with ancestor, the object to check if has ancestor (must have a parentNode attribute!)\r\n\t@param ancestor: HTMLElement, the element to check if is ancestor\r\n\t@return true iff descendant is a descendant of ancestor\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t","google":""}
